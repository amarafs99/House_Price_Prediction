# House_Price_Prediction
"The workflow of this code follows a systematic approach to predict housing prices using linear regression. Here's an overview of the steps involved:

Data Cleaning: The code starts by cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and dropping irrelevant columns. This ensures that the data is in a suitable format for analysis.

Feature Engineering: Next, the code performs feature engineering to derive new features that can enhance the insights and predictive power of the model. Features like 'bhk' (bedrooms, hall, kitchen) and 'price_per_sqft' are created to provide additional information.

Outlier Detection/Removal: The code identifies and removes outliers in key columns such as 'bhk' and 'price_per_sqft'. This step helps in eliminating data points that may significantly impact the model's performance.

Data Visualization: The code generates scatter plots to visualize the relationship between the total square footage and price. These visualizations offer insights into the data distribution and help in understanding any patterns or trends.

Handling Location Data: The code groups the locations and handles those with a low occurrence count. This simplifies the analysis by reducing the number of unique locations and improving model efficiency.

Model Building: The code builds a linear regression model using features such as 'bhk', 'total_sqft', 'bath', 'price_per_sqft', and 'location'. These features are used to train the model and make predictions on housing prices.

Cross-Validation: To ensure the reliability and generalizability of the model, the code employs K-fold cross-validation. This technique partitions the data into multiple subsets and performs training and testing iterations, providing an estimate of the model's performance.

Grid Search: The code utilizes grid search to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters. By systematically testing different combinations of hyperparameters, the code finds the optimal settings that maximize the model's predictive accuracy.

This code demonstrates a structured workflow that covers data cleaning, feature engineering, outlier handling, data visualization, model building, cross-validation, and hyperparameter optimization. It enables accurate predictions of housing prices based on the provided features. Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific needs."
