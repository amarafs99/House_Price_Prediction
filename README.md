# Real Estate Price Prediction Project

## Overview

The **Real Estate Price Prediction** project is a machine learning-based solution that aims to predict the prices of residential properties with high accuracy. This project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation to create a robust prediction system.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project is sourced from a CSV file named `house.csv`. It contains comprehensive information about various residential properties, including essential features such as area type, availability, location, size, society, total square feet area, bathrooms, balconies, and price.

## Data Cleaning

Before building the prediction model, the dataset undergoes thorough data cleaning processes. This includes handling missing values, dropping irrelevant columns, and transforming data for better usability. We also perform data imputation to fill missing values in the 'bath' column with the median value.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering plays a crucial role in enhancing the model's predictive power. In this project, we create a new 'bhk' (bedroom, hall, kitchen) column by extracting the number of bedrooms from the 'size' column. Additionally, we handle ranges in the 'total_sqft' column (e.g., '1000-1200') by converting them to their average values.

To make the location data more manageable, we categorize locations with a count of less than or equal to 10 as 'other.'

## Outlier Detection/Removal

Identifying and handling outliers is vital to ensure the model's robustness. We utilize the interquartile range (IQR) method to detect outliers in the 'bhk' column and exclude properties that have more than 10 bedrooms or less than the sum of bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.

## Model Building

The foundation of the prediction system is laid by training a machine learning model. In this project, we choose the Linear Regression algorithm for its simplicity and efficiency. The model is trained on the training set, and its performance is evaluated on the test set using the R-squared value, which measures its accuracy.

## K-Fold Cross-Validation

To assess the model's performance thoroughly and avoid overfitting, we implement K-Fold Cross-Validation using ShuffleSplit with five splits. This method provides a more reliable estimation of the model's accuracy and generalization to unseen data.

## Grid Search

Fine-tuning the model's hyperparameters is crucial for optimizing its performance. We employ Grid Search, which systematically searches through various combinations of hyperparameters, to find the best configuration for the Linear Regression model.

## Prediction Function

A user-friendly prediction function, aptly named `predict_price`, is developed. It takes inputs such as location, total square feet area, number of bathrooms, and number of bedrooms, and returns the predicted price of the property. This function provides users with a convenient way to estimate property prices for informed decision-making.

## Conclusion

The **Real Estate Price Prediction** project leverages data science and machine learning techniques to predict residential property prices accurately. By combining data cleaning, feature engineering, and the Linear Regression model, along with K-Fold Cross-Validation and Grid Search, we achieve high accuracy and generalization in our predictions. This project can have valuable applications in real estate market analysis and support individuals and organizations in making informed property-related decisions.
